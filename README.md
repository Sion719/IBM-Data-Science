IBM Data Science Capstone Project

This file contains the end-to-end capstone project from course 10 of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, it showcases all the skills learnt from the whole course. In this project, I was tasked with taking on the role of a data scientist working at SpaceX.
SpaceX is known for launching cost-efficient rockets, specifically the F9 launcher, and obtains successful launching outcomes.
The goal was to use public data from SpaceX to gather information on the F9 launcher and SpaceX launch sites.
Using this information, a variety of data collection and manipulation skills were used to obtain a method in which a successful landing outcome during the first stage of SpaceX's rocket launch can be achieved.

The skills showcased in this project:
- Data collection with API
- Data collection with web scraping
- Data wrangling
- Exploratory analysis using SQL
- Interactive visual analytics with Folium
- Interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash
- Machine Learning Prediction (Using SVM, KNN, and Decision Tree models)
